                    <p>The assignment below was the first responsive website written by me. Despite its simplicity, I've learned the basics of coding languages and aesthetics of the design. My goal was to create a friendly and fairly simple user experience.</p>

                <h1>Basic Animation</h1>
                    <p>In this theme I've gained knowledge about basic animation and the understanding of tools which helps me create a project from beginning to the end &#40;storyboard to sprite sheet animation&#41;.</p>

                    <p>This project was a test of previously gained skills in coding and creating a vector graphic animation. Personally, I was responsible for a conceptualization - creating a story, then storyboard and transforming it to the digital version.</p>

                    <p>The following file is a summary of our group work, which shows the time and effort spent on it. It combines persona collage, style tile, storyboard, and state machine diagram.</p>

                    <p>This assignment helped me and my group to understand the following: our goals, strengths, and weaknesses. Overall we raised our awareness and become more focused on the theme's main project.</p>

                    <p>Conceptualization of the idea behind the main project of that theme. Drawing storyboard after a brainstorming session and polishing the story prepared us for an actual shooting later on.</p>

                    <p>Creating a prototype of the website was the next phase of making the project become reality. We thought about the target group, the message, and the usage of different tools to record the video. It was a chance for me to practice designing illustrations.</p>

                    <p>The fully functioning website with a video tutorial was a final product of the theme. During those days I have definitely learned a lot about coding, designing, and video production.</p>

                <h1>Basic UX</h1>
                    <p>Design Sprint took 5 days. The challenge was to improve the currently used university learning portal "Fronter". We had to understand what is missing in the current product and how to elevate it to the most user-friendly level. The prototype of the app is linked on the last page of the documentation.</p>

                    <p>During this exercise, I was faced with a task of coding a responsive page ready to be displayed on a smartphone and a bigger screen. The design is fully based on a previous task of the theme and it is an improved version of the XD prototype.</p>
